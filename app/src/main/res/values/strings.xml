    <string name="bio">"I'm a software engineer who loves building personalized android apps that helps people.
        \n My latest job is relevant to precision agriculture and helps farmers around all over the world.
        \n Right now, I'm working on improving my android skills, accomplish Udacity Nanodegree Program, and looking for a chance to take part in developing a project that enhances people's lives.
    \n My friend asked me how often I check my social media. I thought it over, and I am ready to answer this question.
I can't say that staying in touch isn't interesting at all. Time to time, I look for facts, check out photos on Instagram. But it would be a bit of stretch to say that I am glued to the screen by social media. I couldn't care less if I miss out on an update. It's profitable for me to look up to someone who is growing up and making progress. In the same time, I am playing hardball trying not to listen to word of mouth and trying to think outside the box.
It's not possible for me to post my life online, communicate everything I do. We're short on time and duplicate our life's to social media is a waste of time and not worth it. But I don't want to disapprove others, for someones, it is their work, and they are doing great things. For example, it can be online courses. I adore this studying method!)
What I am using that is instant messaging. I text my friends and family to ask or tell something about three times per day. It's crucial for me to be connected 24/7 to my family)
Coming to an end, I want to say that it is up to us how to use social media and don't feel like"FOMO."
